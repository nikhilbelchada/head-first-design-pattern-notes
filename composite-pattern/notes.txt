Composite Pattern
allow you to compose objects into tree strucutures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
Compoiste lets client treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

If we have a tree strucuture of menus, submenus, and perhaps subsubmenus along with menu items, then any
menu is a "composition" because it can contain both other menus and menu items.
