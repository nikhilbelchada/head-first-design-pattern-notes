Decorator Pattern
Decorators have the same supertype as the objects they decorate.
You cahn use one or more decorators to wrap an objects
The decorator adds its own behavior either before and/or after delegating to the object it decorates to do the rest of the job.
Objects can be decorated at any time, so we can decorate objects dynamically at runtime with as many decorators as we like.
