Facade Pattern
Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes subsystem easier to use.


With it, you can take a complex subsystem and make it easier to use by implementing a Facade class that povides one,
more reasonable interface.

It don't encapsulate the subsystem classes; they merely provide the simplified interface to their functionality.
The subsystem classes till remain available for direct use by clients that need to use more specific interfaces.

It follows Principle of Least Knowledge
